# PatternsLibrary
This was a sandbox project I created a few years ago for learning and practicing various implementations of the Gang of Four patterns in C#. The pattern implementations used in this project were taken from examples provided at http://www.dofactory.com/net/design-patterns. This repository is for personal reference and educational/experimental use only and is not intended to serve any other practical purpose.
